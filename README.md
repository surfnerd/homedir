# homedir
I put this here for myself, but if you'd like to fork and use it, here are some instructions.  FYI I'm using a Mac environment.

1. Clone this repo into your home directory `~`.
2. Run `sh ~/homedir/backupandreplace.sh`
3. Uhhhh, I guess you're done.

This script assumes the names of your files are exactly the same as mine `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

This will rename your old files with the suffix `-old` and create symbolic links to the files in the homedir directory.

Obviously this is my own personal configuration, but it's simple enough without too much fluff and gets the jorb done.

I got stuff from
